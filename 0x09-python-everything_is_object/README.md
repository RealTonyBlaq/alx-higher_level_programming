In Python, everything is an object which can be referenced, aliased
or even assigned to a variable types. There are mutable and immutable
types ranging from lists, tuples, dictionaries, integers, strings, etc.
In this directory, I am learning objects in Python and their behavior
when they are assigned to a variable(or variables), if they are identical
, linked and are stored in the same memory address.
