# PYTHON INHERITANCE


One core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages like Python
is inheritance. This concept or mechanism allows one to share attributes
between classes or derive attributes from another class (Parent class). A parent class also known as the base class can share its attributes to a child class (also called Derived class or subclass) and/or its grandchild. This is called Inheritance.

In this directory, I am learning to use this concept to manipulate and share attributes, properties and methods between classes.
