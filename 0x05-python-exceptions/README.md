Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct,
it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it.
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal.
Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages.
In 0x05-python_exceptions, I am learning to handle and raise exceptions when my programs
perform in an unusual way.
Walk with me.
